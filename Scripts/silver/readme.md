# üì¶ Data Loading and Cleaning Project

## üßæ Overview

This project focuses on the **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)** of data from various **ERP and CRM systems** into a cleaned and structured format using **SQL**. The goal is to **standardize**, **clean**, and **prepare datasets** for downstream use in **analytics, reporting, or data warehousing**.
